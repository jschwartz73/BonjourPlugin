PhoneGap Bonjour Plugin for iOS
==================

This sample project will show how to perform Bonjour (ZeroConf) service browsing, publication, & resolution.  It will also show how to send data between devices via TCP using CocoaAsyncSocket.

I have already included the CocoaAsyncSocket library and frameworks needed in this project.  If you want to use CocoaAsyncSocket in your own project please read here about ARC - https://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaAsyncSocket/wiki/ARC
